 *              Temporary commented out the Styx.CommonBot.LootTargeting.LootMobs because it always returns true.

 *
 * 2012/09/16  v3.5.5.1

 *              Sorted the list numerically (streamlining).
 *
 * 2011/12/26  v3.5.0.6
 *              Added Pouch and Sack o' Coins (Darkmoon Fair) on request of Laria.
 *              Added Lucky Red Envelopes (Lunar Festival Elder reward).
 *
 * 2011/12/26  v3.5.0.5
 *              Added the DragonSoul geodes on request of Laria.
 *              Added Jewelcrafting Daily Cooldowns (Brilliant Glass, Icy Prism and Fire Prism).
 *
 * 2011/11/22  v3.5.0.0
 *              Testing StyxWoW.SleepForLagDuration(); with Tidybags instead of hardcoded delays.
 *
 * 2011/10/20  v3.1.2.2
 *              Increased sleep time for special cases (Croga reported still lootbug).
 *              Added a break when loottime passes 6 seconds.
 *
 * 2011/10/19  v3.1.2.1
 *              Added Tiny Treasure Chest to the special handlers (SBS and HS) as it's soulbound too.
 *              (as reported by Inrego).
 *
 * 2011/10/19  v3.1.2.0
 *              Added accounting for player's lag while opening soulbound containers.
 *              Which could possibly prevent the lootbug appear for SBS and Hidden Stash.
 *
 * 2011/10/19  v3.1.1.3
 *              Added the CloseLoot command to the lua line for Soulbound items to use.
 *
 * 2011/10/19  v3.1.1.2
 *              Added the Hidden Stash to the same code as Strange Bloated Stomache (Lua wise).
 *              Seems that it's soulbound bags and items that are opened are the possible problem.
 *
 * 2011/10/18  v3.1.1.1
 *              Cleaned up the Strange Bloated Stomache lootcode.
 *
 * 2011/10/07  v3.1.1.0
