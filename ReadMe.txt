Hello User of my Repository.

You landed on the repository for TidyBags.
TidyBags is a plugin for HonorBuddy, a World of Warcraft bot.
This is a trivial little addon that keeps your bags clean.

It combines, loots, unpacks, packs and performs other functions when you loot items during your levelling experience.
This way you get the goods without having to do the work.

Any bugs? Report em on the forums in the TidyBags topic.

Thanks, LiquidAtoR.
